_COMP0034 2023-24 Week 5 coding activities_

## Preparation

This assumes you have already forked the coursework repository and cloned the resulting repository to your IDE.

1. Create and activate a virtual environment
2. Install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app `flask --app paralympics run --debug`
4. Open a browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/regions (there is no longer a home page)
5. Stop the app using `CTRL+C`
6. Check that you have an instance folder containing `paralympics.sqlite`

## Introduction
The activities are in two files:

1. [Error handling](activity_errors.md)
2. [Authentication](activity_authentication.md)

Neither of these are mandatory for the coursework baseline.

Effective and consistent error handling is a criterion in the code aspect at the higher grades.

Some students included authentication in their requirements and may therefore wish to implement this. This would
increase the challenge of the solution.
